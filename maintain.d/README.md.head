## With Linux - Quite Messy Collection of Personal Notes

> KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid  

Linux tricks, hints, hacks and many others based on my personal experience with

base, and some of the hints and hacks there are just recored by keywords.  

Lookup keywords within it with the perl utility `ack`. Or use the script
`search` to search for some tips as long as created an xapian database.
