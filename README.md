fakehttpd
=========
! Under development.  
! It can serve some simple-and-single .html files,  
! but many more detailes are to be finished.  
  
[fakehttpd.c](fakehttpd.c)  
This is a very tiny and single-file httpd,  
I say it is "fake" because it doses not stick to 
HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 protocol tightly.  
  
[index.html](index.html)  
An empty html for testing the server.  

## Purpose
What if I just want a simple httpd to offser a static html page ?  
(implemented now, somehow)  
What if I just want a simple tool to pass a file ?  
(doing)
