Tmux 
===

```
C^b "            split pane horizontally
C^b %            split pane vertically
C^b arrow        switch among splits
C^b arrow(hold)  adjust split size
C^b c            create new window
C^b n            move to next window
C^b p            move to previous window
C^b o            move to next split
C^b &            exit tmux
```

`tmux` is a good replacement to `screen`.

GNU Screen

```
C^a |  split, horizontal
C^a S  split, vertical
