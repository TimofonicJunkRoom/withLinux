## What Is Architecture
> john klein, david weiss  

Central to beauty is conceptual integrity -- that is, a set of abstractions
and the rules for using them thoughout the system as simply as possible.

In all disiplines, architecture provides a means for solving a common problem:
assuring that a building, or bridge, or composition, or book, or network, or
system has certain properties and behaviours when it has been built.

A good system architecture exihibits conceptual integrity; that is, it comes
equipped with a set of design rules that aid in reducing complexity and that
can be used as guidande in detailed design and in system verification.

The architecture of a computer system we define as the minimal set of
properties that determine what programs will run and what results they will be.

Architecture is a game of trade-offs -- a decision that improves one the these
characteristics often diminishes another.

In wideruse, the term "architecture" always means "unchanging deep structure".

Structures provide ways to understand the system as sets of interacting
components.

We employ an architect to assure that the design (1) meets the needs; (2) has
conceptual integrity; (3) meets legal and safety requirements.

Architect must make many design decisions.

External behavioral descriptions show how the product will interface with its
users, other systems, and external devices, and should take the form of
requirements. Structural descriptions show how the product is devided into
parts and the relations between those parts. Internal behavioural descriptions
are needed to describe the interface between components.

Software architectures are often presented as layered hierarchies that tend
to commingle several different structures in one diagram.

Describing the structures of an architecture as a set of views, each of which
addresses different concerns, is now accepted as a standard architecture
practice.

Architecture is a part of the design of the system; it highlights some details
by abstracting away from others. Architecture is thus a subset of design.
